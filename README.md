# Amaterasu Memory (Windows)
_Java Memory Library for reading, writing and manipulating memory_

Feel free to use this in any of your projects, however please tell me if you find any problems.

## Upcoming Ideas
- Switch from JNA to JNI (JNI is much quicker then JNA and we could add support for other OS)
- Support for Linux/Mac
- Update some of the code to use less memory consumption

## Credits
I have made this project around a year ago so I guess myself and any forums like stackoverflow

## Used Libraries
[Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) Used for accessing win32 api
